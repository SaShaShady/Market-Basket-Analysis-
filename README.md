# Market-Basket-Analysis-

A Market basket Analysis problem which we solve using the Kmeans Clustering Algorithm with the help of MATLAB

STEP 1-----------------------------------

For the Data Collection part, I have used the Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset which is freely available on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python

Once the Data was imported, I performed Data Preprocessing using various Feature Engineering techniques on it such as:

a. Checking if Null value is present or not

b. Standardizing the data

c. Converting the data from table to Array

STEP 2------------------------------------

Calculating the K or number of clusters value from the Elbow Curve present in the data.

STEP 3-------------------------------------

Plotting the graph of the data

In this graph we can see that we have 5 clusters in total and most of the data has been properly categorised.
